# CS-360
Final project for the course


# Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
This project was designed to create a n application that will manage a a user defined inventory. It will give the user the option to edit add or delete items from the inventory.

# What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
There needed to be at least 2 menu screens in the app as there was a login window and an inventory window. The main factor that was consdiered deuring the design of hte user interface was the need for fast and simple controls. This app was designed to work in a busy enviroment were slow downs could not be afforded. 

# How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
In this project I tried to focus on the main features at once. I had little experience with android and i got confused with the number of interdependant files that were present in the program. Next time i will try and be more selective with what I focus my efforts on first as the core features need  to be done before anything else.

 # How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
 My code unfortunatly was not fully functional but in order to test it I utilized the android device emulator present in android studio. This allowed me to simulate my application running on a device in real time and interact with it as well.
 
 # Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
 In the application design portion of the app i was noit too familar with how the inventory management screen was suppsoed to be laid out. I took it upon myself to try and design a simple interface for each item listed.
 
 # In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
I believe I understood the design more than anything, I just had trouble implementing my ideas into the software.
