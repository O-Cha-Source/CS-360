# CS-360-Android-Inventory-Application

### Description
This application was made in android studio and showcases competency in android application development. This project has multiple components that have been uploaded under “project_1” and “Project_3” individually.


### Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
>This project was designed to create an application that will manage a user defined inventory while giving the user control options such as adding, deleting, and editing items. The application needed to be designed to meet software development best practices.

### What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
>There needed to be at least 2 menu screens in the app as there was a login window and an inventory window. The main factor that was considered during the design of the user interface was the need for fast and simple controls. This app was designed to work in a busy environment were slow downs could not be afforded and as such menus were kept under tabs that could be easily accessible and multiple inventory items would be listed on the screen at once, each with unique and quickly recognizable information about each item.

### How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
>In this project I tried to focus on many of the main features at the same time. I had little experience with android development before this course and I ran into situations where I inadvertently broke something while working on a separate feature. Next time I will try and be more selective with what I focus my efforts on first as the foundational elements must be completed and verified as working before anything can be added on top.

### How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
>My code unfortunately was not fully functional but in order to test it I utilized the android device emulator present in android studio. This allowed me to simulate my application running on a device in real time and interact with it as well. I should have conducted tests each time I added or changed features in order to verify proper function, however tried to test only after I had made large changes. I later ran into issues where foundational components did not function properly. 

### Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
>In the application design portion of the app I wanted to display as much information as possible for each item but quickly bit off more than I could chew as I tried to separate informational screens for each item.
 
### In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
>I believe my design is solid, however I ran into compounding issues during development that effected the end quality of the product. For future work in application development I will be implementing a stricter testing policy that will hopefully eliminate these issues from occurring again.
